        <p class="description">
          Maritime cultures like the Phoenicians and Polynesians were among the first to navigate the open seas. They relied on celestial navigation, using stars, sun, moon, and horizon as points of reference for their journeys.
          <br><br>
          The Polynesian navigators were skilled mariners who relied on their extensive knowledge of the stars and celestial bodies to navigate the open seas. They used a remarkable navigational aid known as the 'star compass,' which was based on a 360-degree coordinate system. While the specific reasons behind their choice remain shrouded in history, the use of 360 degrees hints at a fascinating connection shared with the modern latitude and longitude system we use today, which also employs the same 360-degree concept to represent directions on the Earth's spherical surface. Despite the differences in their navigational practices, both systems demonstrate the remarkable understanding early civilizations had of the Earth's celestial and geometric properties.

        <p class="description">
          The Greek mathematician and geographer Eratosthenes (~276–194 BC) was the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth and the tilt of its axis. His work laid the foundation for understanding the Earth's spherical shape, a key element in navigation.
          <br><br>
          Eratosthenes also proposed a system of latitude and longitude for a map of the world. His prime meridian (line of longitude) passed through Alexandria and Rhodes, while his parallels (lines of latitude) were not regularly spaced, but passed through known locations, often at the expense of being straight lines.

        <p class="subsection-title">Hipparchus: The Architect of Celestial Navigation and Modern Coordinate System"/p>
        <p class="description">
        Hipparchus, a prominent Greek astronomer, geographer, and mathematician, is widely recognized for his significant contributions to the field of astronomy and navigation. He is best known for creating the first comprehensive catalog of stars, which included their positions and brightness, a critical resource for navigators. His work laid the groundwork for the development of trigonometry, a mathematical discipline essential for navigation.
        <br><br>
        Hipparchus is also credited with the invention of the latitude and longitude coordinate system, which is still in use today. This system allows for precise location tracking across the globe, a fundamental aspect of navigation. His discovery of the precession of the equinoxes, the slow westward shift of the equinoctial points along the ecliptic, further demonstrated the importance of astronomical understanding in navigation.
        <br><br>
        His work has had a lasting impact, shaping our understanding of the universe and providing tools and techniques that are still fundamental to navigation and astronomy.

      <p class="description">
        Around 200 BC, the Chinese are credited with the first known use of a compass, which utilized Earth's magnetic field to indicate direction. While initially used for divination, the compass eventually became an essential tool for navigators around the globe.

        <p class="subsection-title">Solving the 'Longitude Problem' - John Harrison and the Marine Chronometer</p>
        <p class="description">
        Navigators could estimate their latitude quite easily by measuring the angle between the horizon and the 'North Star', Polaris. Similarly, in the Southern Hemisphere, the 'Southern Cross' can be used for estimating latitude. However, estimating East/West longitude was a problem as there isn't a fixed celestial body east/west due to Earth's rotation.
        <br><br>
        The 'longitude problem' was solved by John Harrison (1693-1776), an English carpenter and clockmaker. He developed the marine chronometer, a device capable of keeping accurate time at sea, relative to the 'Prime Meridian'. This invention was crucial for determining longitude, solving the so-called "longitude problem" of the era.
