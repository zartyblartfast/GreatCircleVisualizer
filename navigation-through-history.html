            <p class="description">Maritime cultures like the Phoenicians and Polynesians were among the first to navigate the open seas.
                They relied on celestial navigation, using stars, sun, moon, and horizon as points of reference for
                their journeys.

            <p class="description">
                The Greek mathematician and geographer Eratosthenes (~276â€“194 BC) was the first person to calculate
                the circumference of the Earth and the tilt of its axis. His work laid the foundation for
                understanding the Earth's spherical shape, a key element in navigation.

            <p class="description">
                Hipparchus, a prominent Greek astronomer, geographer, and mathematician, is widely recognized for his
                significant contributions to the field of astronomy and navigation.

            </h2>
            <p class="description">
                Navigators could estimate their latitude quite easily by measuring the angle between the horizon and
                the 'North Star', Polaris. Similarly, in the Southern Hemisphere, the 'Southern Cross' can be used for
                estimating latitude.
