      <p>
        Map projections are methods used to represent the curved surface of the Earth on a flat map. They are essential for cartography, navigation, and geographic representation. However, due to the Earth's curved nature, all map projections introduce distortions in some form.

    <div class="description">
      <p>
        There are various types of map projections, each designed to serve specific purposes. Here are some common ones:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mercator Projection: Often used for navigation, but it distorts the size of land masses, making polar regions appear larger than they are.</li>
        <li>Robinson Projection: A compromise projection that aims to balance size and shape distortions, making it popular for general world maps.</li>
        <li>Peters Projection: An equal-area projection that preserves relative sizes of land areas but distorts shapes.</li>
        <!-- Add more projection types as needed -->
      </ul>

      <p>
        Map projections have numerous applications in various fields:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigation: Certain projections, like the Mercator, are useful for navigational purposes and maintaining constant compass directions.</li>
        <li>Geography: Different projections are chosen to showcase specific regions, making them more suitable for regional maps.</li>
        <li>Cartography: Cartographers select projections based on the map's purpose, emphasizing areas, distances, or shapes as needed.</li>
        <!-- Add more real-world applications as needed -->
