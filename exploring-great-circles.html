    <div class="subsection-title">Understanding Rhumb Lines</div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        Rhumb Lines, also known as loxodromes, are constant heading/bearing routes. Although easier to plot on 2D maps, they are not the shortest distance between two points. Explore the concept of Rhumb Lines and their unique properties.

    <div class="subsection-title">The Equator and Lines of Longitude</div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        The Equator is the only line of latitude that is a great circle, thanks to its symmetry and being equidistant from the poles. Interestingly, all lines of longitude are also great circles as they connect the North and South Poles.
