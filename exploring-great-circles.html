    <h1 class="section-title">Exploring Great Circles</h1>
    <p class="description">
      Great circles are the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. Let's delve into the fascinating world of great circles and their significance in navigation and flight paths.

    <h2 class="subsection-title">Visualizing Great Circles</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Witness the beauty of great circles on different map projections and a rotatable globe view on this web page, <b>Great Circles Visualizer</b>.

    <h2 class="subsection-title">Understanding Rhumb Lines</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Rhumb Lines, also known as loxodromes, are constant heading/bearing routes. Although easier to plot on 2D maps, they are not the shortest distance between two points. Explore the concept of Rhumb Lines and their unique properties.

      Discover how the appearance of Rhumb Lines may seem to spiral in certain projections due to map distortion. Don't forget to check the distance information and percentage difference between great circles and Rhumb Lines for specific airport pairs on the web page.

    <h2 class="subsection-title">The Equator and Lines of Longitude</h2>
    <p class="description">
      The Equator is the only line of latitude that is a great circle, thanks to its symmetry and being equidistant from the poles. Interestingly, all lines of longitude are also great circles as they connect the North and South Poles.
